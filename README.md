# Twurst

Twurst is an implementation of [Twirp v7](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/spec_v7.html) in Rust
on top of [`prost`](https://docs.rs/prost/), the [`tower`](https://docs.rs/tower) ecosystem and [`axum`](https://docs.rs/axum).
It fully supports JSON and its server can also serve regular gRPC.

## What is Twirp?

[Twirp](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/spec_v7.html) is a protocol similar to gRPC but with some differences:
- Based on protobuf and gRPC `service` definitions
- Uses plain HTTP 1.1 as a wire format (with upgrade to HTTP 2/3 if the client and server agree)
- No stream requests/responses
- Protobuf JSON format is a first class citizen and can be used instead of protobuf binary encoding
- Errors are encoded as a JSON payload and correct HTTP status code must be used

Useful properties:
- Same protocol level behaviors as web browsers and tools like `curl` or `reqwest` just work
- JSON if text based human-readable communications are required
- Same definition files as gRPC, fairly simple migration coming from gRPC

Twirp has been created by Twitch and its [original implementation](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp) is in Go.
A [list of other implementations is provided](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp?tab=readme-ov-file#implementations-in-other-languages).

## This implementation

This is a simple implementation of Twirp.
Its aim is to be a replacement of [`tonic`](https://docs.rs/tonic/) using Twirp instead of gRPC.
It is also based on [`prost`](https://docs.rs/prost/) with the help of [`prost-reflect`](https://docs.rs/prost-reflect/) for JSON support.

It is split into multiple crates:
- [`twurst-build`](./build) is the equivalent of `tonic-build` for Twirp: it generates code from the `.proto` files.
- [`twurst-client`](./client) wraps a [`reqwest::Client`](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/struct.Client.html) or any [`tower::Service`](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/trait.Service.html)
  and provides the needed code for the `*Client` structs generated by `twurst-build` to work.
- [`twurst-server`](./server) implements a Twirp server on top of [`axum`](https://docs.rs/axum/) from an implementation of the service trait generated by `twurst-build`.
  It is not a fully fledged server but only an [`axum::Router`](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/struct.Router.html) that can be integrated into a bigger HTTP server
  (remind, Twirp uses regular HTTP(S)).
- [`twurst-error`](./error) provides the `TwirpError` type (think [`tonic::Status`](https://docs.rs/tonic/latest/tonic/struct.Status.html) but for Twirp).
  It is reexported by the other crates, and you should not need to depend on it directly.

Client and server examples are provided in the `example` directory.
`example/js-client` provides an example of a naive JS client.

Support for gRPC is also provided behind the `grpc` feature in `twurst-build` and `twurst-server`.
It allows to easily serve both Twirp and gRPC.
`example/server` provides an example.

For more detailed documentation see the [client](./client) and the [server](./server) READMEs.

## Getting started

1. Read the `example/client` and `example/server` directories.
2. Copy/paste and adapt the code if you want to build a server or a client.
3. Read the [client](./client) and/or the [server](./server) READMEs for more documentation.

## Differences with other Twirp implementations
- [`prost_twirp`](https://docs.rs/prost-twirp) does not support JSON, Twirp 7 and last commit was on January 2023.
- [`twirp-rs`](https://github.com/github/twirp-rs) does not allow any Tower `Service` in the client, has a more restricted JSON support based on `prost-wkt` and not on `prost-reflect` leading to eg. troubles with [`oneOf` support](https://github.com/fdeantoni/prost-wkt?tab=readme-ov-file#oneof-types) or does not support custom fields based on Axum extractors added to the server generated methods.
